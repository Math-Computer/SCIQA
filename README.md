## Model

* You can use "main_demo.m" to calculate the perceptual quality of two images.

## Training & Testing

* Training dataset: Kadid10k
* Testing: datasets: LIVE, CSIQ, TID2013
* You can use "training_and_testing.m" to implement training and testing on the datasets. You can directly download the pre-extracted features of images in these datasets ("kadid.mat", "live.mat", "csiq.mat", "tid.mat") from <a href="">[hhttps://pan.baidu.com/s/1UmuO71fLER_zj24QcUgelQ?pwd=SCIQ](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1UmuO71fLER_zj24QcUgelQ?pwd=SCIQ )</a> (password:SCIQ)
